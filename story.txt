Anshul's Story

Once upon a time there was a guy named Dave who wanted to go swimming.
He lived near a lake infested with gators, but loved swimming so much that he
decided to jump in anyways.

He saw a shark coming when he swam in this lake. And immediately he decided to swim back. 

Dave seen this shark before he knew it was only here for one reason. The sharks have came to declear war on the gators to claim their waters.
The lake is no longer safe to swim in.
